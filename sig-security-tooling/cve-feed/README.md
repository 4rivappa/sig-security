# Official CVE Feed

The official CVE feed is separated into two main components:
1. The scripts, that update a cloud bucket containing the feed.
2. The website, rendering and serving the feed in various formats.

## Scripts

A script in the [kubernetes/sig-security](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-security)
repository under the [sig-security-tooling/cve-feed/hack](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-security/tree/main/sig-security-tooling/cve-feed/hack)
folder. This script is
a bash script named `fetch-cve-feed.sh` that:
- sets up the python3 environment;
- generates the CVE feed file with `fetch-official-cve-feed.py`;
- compares the sha256 of the newly generated file with the existing one;
- if the sha256 changed, uploads the newly generated CVE feed file to the bucket.

The `fetch-official-cve-feed.py` file executed by the `fetch-cve-feed.sh` is a
python3 script that:
- queries the GitHub API to fetch all the issues with the `official-cve-feed`
  label in the [kubernetes/kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3Aofficial-cve-feed%20)
  repository;
- formats the result with the appropriate JSON schema to be JSON feed
  compliant;
- prints the output to stdout.

These scripts are run regularly as a CronJob on the k8s infrastructure.

In short, these scripts take the GitHub [kubernetes/kubernetes issues
labeled with `official-cve-feed`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3Aofficial-cve-feed%20)
as the input and generate a JSON feed file as an output in a cloud bucket. The
output can be publicly fetched at [gs://k8s-cve-feed/](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/k8s-cve-feed) or [storage.googleapis.com/k8s-cve-feed](https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-cve-feed/).

## Website

The main output of the official CVE feed is the HTML website page available on
[k8s.io/docs/reference/issues-security/official-cve-feed](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/issues-security/official-cve-feed/)
where you can also find links to the JSON and RSS feed formats.

The corresponding HTML page is generated from the [official-cve-feed.md](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/main/content/en/docs/reference/issues-security/official-cve-feed.md?plain=1)
file from the [kubernetes/website](https://github.com/kubernetes/website)
repository. It mainly calls the `cve-feed` shortcode that is defined in
[website/layouts/shortcodes/cve-feed.html](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/main/layouts/shortcodes/cve-feed.html)
which consumes the JSON format by fetching the URL from the
[`.Site.Params.cveFeedBucket`](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/75f19fc9675d07fdbc724d02953d905ef7ca8619/hugo.toml#L168)
and translating it to an HTML table.

This page is thus updated every time the website is built.
