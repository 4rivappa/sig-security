# Security Self-assessment
A Security Self-assessment is a great starting point for Kubernetes subprojects to reach a security baseline. Our team 
will work with project maintainers create a threat model and assess the current security stance of all or a portion of 
the project. The resulting assessment will allow maintainers to determine gaps in their project's security and develop a
strategy to work toward improving it.

## Getting Started
If you have a project for which you would like to complete a Security Self-assessment you can take a look at the 
[Self-assessment Recipe Book](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-security/blob/main/sig-security-assessments/recipe-book.md)
for next steps.

## Getting Involved
If you would like to participate in the SIG-Security Security Self-assessment subject please join the SIG-Security
[mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-security) to be added to meeting invites.
